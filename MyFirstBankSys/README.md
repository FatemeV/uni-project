# MyFirstBankSys

A beginner-level desktop banking management system built with Python and PyQt5.  
This project was developed as a university assignment during my first month of learning Python — without any help from AI tools like ChatGPT — just through YouTube tutorials and independent research.

## 📌 Overview

**MyFirstBankSys** is a simple desktop application intended to simulate a basic banking system interface.  
It features two user roles: **Admin** and **Customer**.

🔐 **Admin Login:**

### Admin Panel:
- View all customers' data
- Add new customer (incomplete)

### Customer Panel:
- View personal account data
- Change password

> ⚠️ Many features are partially implemented or UI-only. Some functionalities are not working due to lack of time.
