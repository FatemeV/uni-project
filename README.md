# 🎓 University Projects

This repository contains my university projects — imperfect and raw, but deeply meaningful to me.  
They were the starting points of exciting paths I later followed and grew from.

> 💡 Each folder contains a separate project, with its own description and structure.

🤝 If you improve or build upon any of these projects, I'd love to see it!  
Feel free to share your version with me — I'm always curious to learn from others.
